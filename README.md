# DissertationProject
Repository for my dissertation project "Unsmart Home - Scrambled Memory"

The goal of this project was to create an object sorting puzzle using RFID Readers and a Raspberry Pi.

The code to run the project is in ProjectCode, any code I experimented with is in the file experimentation.

The program only runs when connected to the web hub and to the RFID readers.
